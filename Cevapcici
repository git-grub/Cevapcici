# Croatian Inspired Cevapcici

Cevapcici, often abbreviated "Cevapi" are a South-Eastern European saussage-shaped street food typically made from
minced beef, lamb and/or pork. They're a bit like Kofta and every bit as delicious.

This recipe is best made the day before you plan to eat it and the uncooked mixture shoud be left in the fridge
overnight for the flavours to permeate and the meat to tenderize.

You can use 500g packets of minced meat, and will easily satisfy 4 people.

* Smoked Chorizo ( optional ) for an extra flavour kick
