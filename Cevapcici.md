# Croatian Inspired Cevapcici

Cevapcici, often abbreviated "Cevapi" are a South-Eastern European saussage-shaped street food typically made from
minced beef, lamb and/or pork. They're a bit like Kofta and every bit as delicious.

This recipe is best made the day before you plan to eat it and the uncooked mixture shoud be left in the fridge
overnight for the flavours to permeate and the meat to tenderize.

You can use 500g packets of minced meat, and will easily satisfy 4 people.

# You'll need

* Equal parts lamb and pork mince, or beef and pork if you prefer it
* Smoked Chorizo ( optional ) for an extra flavour kick
* Parsely
* 1 red onion
* 3 cloves of garlic
* Bicarbinate of Soda
* Paprika
* Salt & Pepper

# Getting Started

## Step 1. Preparing the ingredients

Finely chop the garlic, onion and parsely. The finer the better, since large chunks of onion will stop your Cevaps holding together when it comes to shaping them.

Turn the lamb and pork ( or your meat of choice ) out into a medium mixing bowl ( you're going to want to fit it into the fridge ) and gently mix them together with a spoon. Don't squish or compress them, you want your mixture to be loose and airy so the flavours can permeate overnight.

## Step 2. Fold in the onion, garlic and parsely

Toss your onion, garlic and parsely on top of the meat and continue to fold it in, again be gentle with the mixture and keep it loose and airy.

# Step 3. Season to taste
